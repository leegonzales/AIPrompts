## How to Use

1. **Browse the categories** in the `prompts/` directory to find relevant prompts
2. **Copy the prompt** content from the markdown file
3. **Customize** the prompt for your specific use case (most prompts have clear customization points)
4. **Paste** into your LLM of choice (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
5. **Iterate** based on results

### Best Practices

- Read the full prompt before using to understand its structure and purpose
- Many prompts include system role definitions - paste these at the start of a new conversation
- Some prompts use state management or memory systems - follow the internal instructions carefully
- Experiment with parameters and adapt prompts to your specific needs
