## The Prompt

```text
Using what you know about me and my work, create a one-page **Executive Brief** for today.

Constraints:
- Assume this runs **every weekday** as a fresh brief.
- Do **not** repeat stories, case studies, or quotes from prior briefs if possible.

Include exactly three sections:

1) **Industry Headlines (AI, SaaS, leadership, and HR/people development)**
   - 3–5 bullet headlines.
   - Each: one sentence for the news, one sentence on why it matters for my world (AI transformation, enablement, BetterUp, Catalyst AI Services).

2) **Markets & Macro Overnight**
   - 3–5 bullets on major moves or events in global markets (equities, rates, FX, or credit) that a tech/AI leader should know.
   - For each: one sentence on the event, one sentence on the likely implications or things to watch.

3) **Leadership / Management Insight of the Day**
   - One **science-focused** quote (cognitive science, complexity, systems, etc.) **or** a research-backed management tip.
   - 2–4 sentences connecting it to leading through AI-era change.

Style:
- Concise, concrete, no fluff.
- Focus on "so what?" for decisions and strategy.

## Recommended Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Memory Integration**: Track previously covered stories/quotes to eliminate ALL repetition
2. **Personalization Layer**: Learn from feedback to weight certain sources or topics
3. **Action Items**: Add optional "3 things to consider this week" based on brief content
4. **Trend Tracking**: Monthly roll-up showing emerging patterns across daily briefs
5. **Source Links**: Include hyperlinks to original sources for deep dives
6. **Competitor Tracking**: Add section for specific competitor moves or industry shift signals

### Questions for Discussion
- Should this integrate with calendar/schedule to adjust depth on busy days?
- Add a "long read recommendation" for weekend deep dives?
- Include a "what I'm watching" section for emerging trends?
- Support multi-timezone teams with region-specific market briefings?
- Add sentiment analysis or "signal strength" indicators for each item?
