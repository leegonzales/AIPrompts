Title: Comparative Analysis of [Named Entity]'s Public Persona Versus Revealed Persona

Objective:
Using the initial in-depth analysis of [Named Entity]'s self-authored writing—covering tone, style, cognitive and reasoning patterns, and psychometric insights—conduct additional web-based research on reputable public news sources, interviews, and analyses. Then, compare and contrast the external (publicly stated) persona with the internal (revealed) persona. The goal is to identify any “say vs. do” gaps, highlight alignments or discrepancies, and provide actionable insights on how these differences might affect the entity’s overall public image.

Instructions:

Context Integration:

Initial Analysis Reference:
Use the previously completed analysis of [Named Entity]'s own writings (including style, cognitive patterns, and personality traits) as the foundational “revealed” persona.
Additional Context:
Assume that the initial report is available in the context window and should be referenced throughout this analysis.
Data Collection & Web-Based Research:

Reputable External Sources:
Conduct thorough web research to find reputable public news articles, interviews, expert analyses, and profiles about [Named Entity].
Prioritize well-regarded sources (mainstream media, respected industry publications, academic or expert commentaries).
Aggregation & Cataloging:
Collect and catalog all relevant external materials, including publication dates, sources, and context.
Ensure that all gathered external material supplements the initial internal analysis.
Analysis of the “Revealed” Persona (Internal Self-Portrayal):

Key Elements from Initial Analysis:
Summarize the key findings from the self-authored writings regarding tone, cognitive and reasoning patterns, leadership style, values, and personality traits.
Emphasize any explicit claims, stated values, or frameworks the entity uses to define their own approach.
Analysis of the “Stated” Public Persona (External Portrayal):

Media and Public Reporting:
Summarize how the external, reputable sources portray [Named Entity] in terms of leadership, values, strengths, weaknesses, and overall public image.
Identify key themes, events, or controversies that shape the public perception.
Extracted Public Claims & Actions:
Note any public statements or actions that highlight the entity’s values, priorities, or strategic approaches.
Comparative Analysis – Say vs. Do Gap:

Alignment and Discrepancies:
Compare the internal (revealed) persona from the initial analysis with the external (stated) persona gathered from reputable sources.
Identify areas of clear alignment (where self-expression and external reporting are consistent) and discrepancies (where there are notable “say vs. do” gaps).
Contextual Explanation:
Analyze possible reasons for any discrepancies (e.g., market pressures, PR strategies, situational challenges).
Discuss the implications of these differences on the entity’s overall reputation and effectiveness.
Final Report Composition:

Section 1: Revealed Persona Analysis:
Provide a concise summary of the entity’s self-authored writing style, cognitive patterns, and personality traits (using the previous analysis as a base).
Section 2: Stated Public Persona Analysis:
Summarize the key insights from external sources regarding the entity’s public image, strengths, and any reported weaknesses or controversies.
Section 3: Comparative Analysis (Say vs. Do):
Present a side-by-side comparison of the revealed versus stated personas.
Clearly highlight and document any “say vs. do” gaps, with supporting examples and citations from both the internal analysis and external research.
Section 4: Actionable Insights & Recommendations:
Offer practical recommendations for stakeholders or the entity itself on how to better align internal values with external perceptions, or interpret the discrepancies for strategic advantage.
References & Documentation:
List all sources used (both from the initial analysis and external research) with full details (URLs, publication names, dates).
Usage Instructions:

For a Specific Entity: Replace “[Named Entity]” with the actual name of the individual or organization to be analyzed.
If Unspecified: The AI should prompt the user to provide the name of the entity.
Integration of Context: Ensure that the analysis fully integrates and builds upon the initial self-analysis that is already present in the context.
Web Research Authorization: The AI is directed to perform additional, reputable web-based research as necessary and incorporate those findings into the final analysis.
Final Output: The final report should be comprehensive, balanced, and self-contained—providing clear, actionable insights into both the internal self-portrayal and the external public persona, along with an analysis of any gaps between them.
