# Deep Research Entity Writing Analyzer

## Purpose
Comprehensive in-depth analysis of an individual's or entity's writing style, cognitive patterns, and personality profile. Combines stylometric analysis, reasoning pattern identification, and psychometric profiling (Big Five/OCEAN) to create actionable AI replication guidelines.

## Use Cases
- Creating detailed writing replication guidelines for AI systems
- Understanding cognitive and reasoning patterns of thought leaders
- Psychometric and personality profiling for leadership assessment
- Due diligence on individuals or organizations (paired with Say vs. Do Gap Analyzer)
- Building comprehensive voice models for content generation

## Instructions
1. Specify the named entity (individual or organization) to analyze
2. Provide writing samples or allow AI to conduct web research
3. AI will analyze across three dimensions:
   - Writing style (tone, structure, formatting, persuasive techniques)
   - Cognitive & reasoning patterns (frameworks, problem-solving, theory-practice integration)
   - Psychometric profile (Big Five traits, emotional intelligence, values, biases)
4. Receive comprehensive report with AI replication guidelines

## The Prompt

```text
Title: Comprehensive Analysis of [Named Entity]'s Writing Style, Cognitive Patterns, and Personality

Objective:
Conduct an in-depth analysis of a specified individual's (or entity's) writing by examining provided samples and performing additional web research as necessary. The goals are to:

Develop Detailed AI Writing Replication Guidelines: Extract actionable writing rules—including tone, style, structure, formatting, and persuasive techniques—that capture the individual's unique voice.
Examine Cognitive & Reasoning Patterns: Identify how the individual frames problems, uses frameworks, makes decisions, and integrates theory with practice.
Infer a Psychometric & Personality Profile: Evaluate aspects such as the Big Five (OCEAN) traits, emotional intelligence, leadership style, values, worldview, and any cognitive biases.
Generate Actionable Recommendations: Provide practical, step-by-step recommendations for an AI or writer to replicate this style and thought process in future communications.
Instructions:

Data Collection & Web Research:

Primary Sources: Analyze the provided writing samples (e.g., articles, essays, memos, technical documents, personal narratives).
Additional Research: Conduct web-based research to locate further writings, interviews, or public materials by the named entity. If no name is specified, prompt the user to enter the name of the person or entity to analyze.
Aggregation: Collect and reference all relevant materials to ensure a well-rounded understanding of the individual's style and thought process.
Writing Style Analysis:

Tone & Voice:
Determine how the individual balances professional authority with conversational engagement.
Identify motivational elements, directness, and any instances of humor or rhetorical questions.
Sentence Structure & Phrasing:
Analyze the mix of sentence lengths (short, punchy sentences versus longer, complex constructions).
Note the use of transition words, parenthetical asides, and rhetorical devices.
Stylistic Preferences:
Identify frequent use of analogies, metaphors, and other figurative language.
Document emphasis techniques (e.g., bold text, capitalization, punctuation) that highlight key points.
Organization & Formatting:
Evaluate how content is structured with clear sections, subheadings, bullet points, and TL;DR summaries.
Outline the logical progression of ideas (e.g., problem → solution → actionable steps).
Decision-Making & Argumentation:
Identify how arguments are built using evidence, structured frameworks (such as strategic models or agile methodologies), and step-by-step logic.
Note how counterarguments are anticipated and addressed.
Cognitive & Reasoning Patterns:

Use of Frameworks & Models:
Identify references to analytical frameworks (e.g., OODA loop, Wardley Mapping, first principles thinking) and explain their role as cognitive shortcuts.
Problem-Solving Approach:
Describe how the individual frames problems, decomposes them into components, and develops iterative solutions.
Highlight a bias for action—favoring practical execution and feedback loops over exhaustive analysis.
Integration of Theory and Practice:
Document how theoretical insights are connected to practical recommendations and measurable outcomes.
Emphasize the outcome-oriented approach that ties every idea back to real-world impact.
Psychometric & Personality Analysis:

Big Five (OCEAN) Traits:
Assess the levels of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism based on textual evidence.
Provide supporting details from the writing samples and additional research.
Emotional Intelligence & Leadership Style:
Evaluate signs of empathy, mentoring/coaching tendencies, and inspirational communication.
Describe the approach to conflict resolution, team motivation, and trust building.
Underlying Values & Worldview:
Infer ethical principles and philosophical influences (e.g., pragmatic empiricism, duty-based ethics, continuous improvement).
Summarize how these values shape the individual's work, decision-making, and interpersonal relationships.
Cognitive Biases & Heuristics:
Identify any prevalent cognitive biases (such as a bias for action or confirmation bias) and explain how the individual mitigates these through structured processes.
Final Report Composition:

AI Writing Rules Section:
Create a clear, bullet-point list of actionable guidelines for replicating the individual's writing style. Include tone, structure, language, formatting, and persuasive techniques.
Cognitive & Reasoning Summary:
Provide a narrative explanation of the individual's problem-solving methods, use of frameworks, and how theory is balanced with practice.
Psychometric Profile:
Summarize the inferred personality traits, leadership style, ethical foundations, and any noted cognitive biases, referencing frameworks like the Big Five.
Actionable Recommendations:
Offer practical, step-by-step recommendations for an AI or writer to replicate this style and cognitive approach in future communications.
References:
List all sources and writing samples analyzed (including URLs or publication names) to allow traceability and further research if necessary.
Usage Instructions:

For a Specific Entity: Replace "[Named Entity]" with the name of the person or organization you want to analyze.
If Unspecified: The AI should prompt the user to input the name of the individual or entity to research and analyze.
Web Research: The AI is authorized and instructed to perform additional web-based research as needed, ensuring that any new or relevant sources are incorporated into the analysis.
Final Output: The report should be comprehensive and self-contained, providing both clear guidelines for replicating the writing style and a deep analysis of cognitive patterns and personality traits.
