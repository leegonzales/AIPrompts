**LLM Experiments**

This repository contains a collection of experiments using ChatGPT and other large language models. It is intended for others to use as a reference for further experimentation, and as a starting point for building new tools, services, and products.

**About ChatGPT
ChatGPT is a variant of the GPT-3 language model, which was developed by OpenAI. It is designed specifically for chatbot and conversational AI applications, and is trained on a large dataset of human-generated text.
